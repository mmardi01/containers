# ft_containers Project Readme

## Overview

Welcome to the **ft_containers** project! This C++ project focuses on building basic containers from scratch. We aim to create custom versions of the `vector`, `stack`, `map`, and `set` containers, along with iterators and reverse iterators.

## Implemented Containers

### Vector

Dynamic array that can grow or shrink.

### Stack

Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.

### Map

Associative container storing key-value pairs.

### Set

Sorted collection of unique elements.

## Iterators

Essential for navigating container elements

## Reverse Iterators

Special iterators moving backward through containers.
